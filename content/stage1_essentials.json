    "explanation": "Welcome to Prompt Quest! The secret to getting great results from AI isn't magic—it's clarity. Think of the AI as a brilliant but very literal intern. It wants to help, but it needs precise instructions. The most common mistake is assuming the AI knows what you want without you saying it. In this stage, we focus on the 'Essentials': telling the AI exactly **what** to do, **who** it is for, and **how** it should look.",
    "keyPrinciples": [
      "**The Golden Rule of Specificity**: Never just say 'write about X'. Say 'write a [format] about [topic] for [audience]'.",
      "**Context is King**: Give the AI the background information it needs. Why are you asking? What is the goal?",
      "**Format Control**: You can tell the AI exactly how to structure its answer (bullet points, table, single sentence)."
    ],
    "commonMistakes": [
      "Being too vague (e.g., 'Help me with this')",
      "Forgetting to define the audience (resulting in answers that are too simple or too complex)",
      "ignoring output limits (getting a 5-page essay when you needed a paragraph)"
