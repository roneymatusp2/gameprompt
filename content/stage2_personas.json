    "explanation": "In Stage 1, you learned to give clear instructions. Now, we unlock the AI's creative potential by giving it a 'Role'. When you ask an AI to 'Act as a biology teacher' or 'Respond as a grumpy pirate', you are setting a 'Persona'. This is powerful because it automatically brings in a whole set of assumptions about knowledge, vocabulary, and tone without you having to list them all. It's like giving the AI a costume and a script.",
    "keyPrinciples": [
      "**The 'Act As' Hack**: Starting your prompt with 'Act as [Role]' primes the AI to access specific knowledge and vocabulary associated with that role.",
      "**Tone Matching**: A persona dictates tone. A 'judge' is formal and serious; a 'clown' is silly and chaotic. Use roles to instantly set the vibe.",
      "**Perspective Taking**: You can use personas to see a problem from different angles. How would a 'lawyer' view this contract vs. a 'designer'?"
    ],
    "commonMistakes": [
      "Using generic roles like 'an expert' instead of specific ones like 'a senior Python developer'.",
      "Forgetting to tell the AI who it is talking *to* (the audience) after defining who *it* is.",
      "Letting the persona override the facts (e.g., a 'funny' persona giving incorrect serious advice)."

      "goodPrompt": "Act as a polite but firm elderly neighbour. Write a formal letter to the young couple next door complaining about their loud music last night.",
      "explanation": "The bad prompt has no personality. The good prompt sets a specific character (polite, elderly neighbour) which dictates the vocabulary ('I am writing to express my concern...') and tone.",
      "expectedOutputPreview": "Dear Neighbours, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to gently bring to your attention the volume of the music coming from your flat last evening..."

      "badPrompt": "Tell me about Mars.",
      "goodPrompt": "You are an enthusiastic astronaut who has just landed on Mars. Describe the landscape to a group of school children back on Earth.",
      "explanation": "Instead of a dry encyclopaedia entry, the good prompt creates a story. The 'enthusiastic astronaut' persona adds emotion ('It's breathtaking!') and the audience (children) keeps it simple.",

      "badPrompt": "Give me interview advice.",
      "goodPrompt": "Act as a strict corporate recruiter at a top bank. Give me 3 hard truths about why candidates fail their interviews.",
      "explanation": "Specifying 'strict corporate recruiter' signals the AI to give direct, perhaps harsh, feedback rather than generic, fluffy advice.",
      "expectedOutputPreview": "1. **You're too rehearsed.** We can tell when you're reading a script. \n2. **You didn't do your homework.** If you don't know our stock price, don't bother showing up..."
