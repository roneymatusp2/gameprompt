    "explanation": "You can act as a genius expert (Stage 2), but if that genius gives you a wall of unstructured text, it's useless. Stage 3 is about being an architect. You don't just ask for *information*; you define the *blueprint* for how that information is presented. AI models are incredibly good at following structural rules. You can ask for tables, code blocks, bullet points, or even specific file formats like CSV or JSON. This is the secret to turning AI from a 'chatbot' into a productivity tool.",
    "keyPrinciples": [
      "**Format is a Constraint**: Asking for a 'table' or a 'list' is a type of constraint that forces the AI to organise its thoughts.",
      "**Be Explicit**: Don't say 'organise this'. Say 'create a 3-column table with headers: Name, Date, and Score'.",
      "**Templates Work**: You can provide a 'skeleton' (e.g., 'Use this format: Title -> Summary -> Key Points') and ask the AI to fill it in."
    ],
    "commonMistakes": [
      "Asking for a 'list' when you actually need a 'table' to compare data.",
      "Forgetting to specify headers for tables (leaving the AI to guess relevant columns).",
      "Assuming the AI knows your preferred software format (e.g., asking for 'data' instead of 'CSV format for Excel')."
