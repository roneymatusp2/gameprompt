    "explanation": "It sounds contradictory, but AI is *more* creative when you give it limits. If you say 'Write a story', you might get a generic fairy tale. If you say 'Write a story using exactly 50 words about a robot who loves tea, without using the letter E', you get something unique. This is 'Bounded Creativity'. Stage 4 is about learning to use constraints—both positive (do this) and negative (do NOT do this)—to force the AI out of its boring, average habits.",
    "keyPrinciples": [
      "**The Blank Page Paradox**: Total freedom often leads to average results. Constraints force the AI to search deeper in its neural network for solutions.",
      "**Negative Constraints**: Telling the AI what *not* to include (e.g., 'no jargon', 'no ethical lectures', 'no intro text') is as important as what to include.",
      "**Hard Limits**: Strict rules like word counts ('under 280 characters') or format limits ('start every sentence with S') are excellent for testing AI capability."
    ],
    "commonMistakes": [
      "Being vague about limits (e.g., 'make it short' vs 'under 50 words').",
      "Over-constraining to the point of impossibility (e.g., 'write a novel in 1 word').",
      "Forgetting to check if the AI actually followed the negative constraints (they sometimes struggle with 'not')."
