    "explanation": "The biggest myth about AI is that you have to get the prompt perfect on the first try. In reality, prompt engineering is a conversation. Stage 5 is about what happens *after* the first result. Sometimes the AI gives you a boring answer, a wrong answer, or ignores your rules. Instead of starting over, you 'iterate'. You can ask the AI to fix specific parts, change the tone, or even critique its own work to find improvements. This is how you go from 'good' to 'perfect'.",
    "keyPrinciples": [
      "**Iterate, Don't Restart**: If the output is 80% right, use your next prompt to fix the remaining 20%. (e.g., 'That's good, but make the tone funnier').",
      "**The Self-Correction Hack**: You can ask the AI to review its own output. 'Read your previous answer. Did you follow the word count rule? If not, rewrite it.'",
      "**Diagnosis**: If an answer is vague, your prompt was likely vague. If an answer is wrong (hallucination), you probably asked for a fact it doesn't know or didn't provide enough context."
    ],
    "commonMistakes": [
      "Accepting the first mediocre result and thinking 'AI isn't smart enough'.",
      "Rewriting the *entire* prompt when a simple follow-up instruction ('Make it shorter') would work.",
      "Getting stuck in a loop of bad answers (sometimes it IS better to start a new chat context)."
